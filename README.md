# Community-Driven Open Source Problem Directory

Welcome to the **Community-Driven Open Source Problem Directory**! Here, anyone can contribute coding problems along with test cases, base solution templates, and driver code in various languages. This project aims to build a diverse collection of programming challenges that will help developers sharpen their skills and learn from each other.

## Contributing Your Own Problems

We encourage you to submit problems that follow the structure outlined below. This ensures consistency and clarity for others to understand and solve them.

### Problem Structure

Each problem you contribute should include the following components:

1. **Problem Statement**
   - A clear description of the problem, including input and output specifications.
   
2. **Test Cases**
   - Provide a minimum of 3 test cases to validate solutions.
   - Test cases should include edge cases and corner cases.
   - Format:
     - **Input**: Example inputs for the problem.
     - **Expected Output**: The output that should be returned for the corresponding input.

3. **Expected Output**
   - Define the expected result for each test case.
   - Ensure that the output format is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Base Solution Template**
   - Provide a basic template for the solution in a specific programming language.
   - This template should include a function signature and comments to guide the problem solver.
   - Example (in Python):
     ```python
     # Define the function here
     def solve_problem(input_data):
         # Write your solution here
         pass
     ```

5. **Driver Code**
   - Include driver code that runs the problem with the provided test cases.
   - Example (in Python):
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         # Example test case
         input_data = "example_input"
         result = solve_problem(input_data)
         print(result)  # Expected: "expected_output"
     ```

### Example Problem Submission

Here is an example of how to submit a problem:

#### Problem: **Find the Maximum Element in an Array**

**Description**:  
Given an array of integers, write a function to return the maximum element.

**Input**:  
An array of integers.

**Output**:  
A single integer representing the maximum value.

#### Test Cases:
```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Expected Output: 9

Input: [-1, -5, -10, -3]
Expected Output: -1

Input: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
Expected Output: 500
